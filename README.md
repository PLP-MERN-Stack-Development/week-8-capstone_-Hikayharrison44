# This project is a modern, full-stack e-commerce application built as a capstone for the MERN Stack course. It demonstrates core skills in MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js, with a focus on clean architecture, scalability, and user experience. The frontend is developed using React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn-ui for a responsive and visually appealing interface. The backend leverages Supabase for database management and authentication, providing secure and real-time data operations

3 Key features include user authentication, a product catalog with categories and search, a persistent shopping cart, and a streamlined checkout process. The application is structured using a feature-based architecture for maintainability and ease of extension. Comprehensive testing, CI/CD pipelines, and detailed documentation ensure code quality and smooth deployment.

This project serves as a showcase of practical MERN stack skills, modern frontend development, and best practices in full-stack application design.
